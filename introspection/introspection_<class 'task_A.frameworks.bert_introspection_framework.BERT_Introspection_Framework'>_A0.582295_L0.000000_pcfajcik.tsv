If the government loved us they would hand out free Vit C and worry about iodine levels. 

Instead, like an abusive partner, they dump nero-toxins in the drinking water and allow chemicals no on can pronounce into the food.

You know, maybe the government doesn't love us.

Well what else are you supposed to read when you forget your phone on your way to the shitter?

No one has to read shampoo instructions by the way, they're only there cause its legally required in some places. If you were trying to say, ""I bet you're the reason they have to put instructions on shampoo bottles"" then your response makes slightly more sense. It is still extremely stupid though, as your choosing a poorly worded, irrelevant, and blatantly nonsensical attempt at an insult over an actual argument for the point you were trying to make.

Altogether, your response has zero relevance with the post or my initial comment so now you just look even more retarded than you did for trying to argue that the picture and the title are not of relation to each other. Let me explain something to you that you seem to not understand. 
The reason O.P. Is asking the question is because they saw the photo and the numbers sound iffy. It makes no sense that they would have had the question and then found a corresponding photo. The question O.P. asks in the title is meant to be based on what is in the picture; their questions wording doesn't specify that they mean this specific incident but if any sort of common sense is used you can see that they're asking based on a specific incident because thats what is discussed in the photo that leads to the question. I think your confusion is based largely on the last words of the sentence ""in its entire existence"" if you use the photo for context, as that is where the question stems from, its clear that the ""it"" in that sentence is humanity and not the mountain.

Never heard of the poisonous M&amp;M analogy? If you have a bowl of 100 M&amp;Ms, and one is poisonous, you have to treat them all like they're poisonous. Same thing with men and rapists.

MS-13 was also created in the US, and deporting gang members back is how it gained a foothold in Central America. They have also been extremely active in Mexico.

The gang also possible traces roots back to the Salvadoran civil war, which was exacerbated by the US pumping military aid to the Salvadoran government. The Salvadoran government has been found to have been responsible for most of the civilian casualties.

So, one of the largest, most active gangs is actually a by-product of US-government led actions."

Well Trump and his ilk point out that crossing the border without papers is criminal and therefore every undocumented person is a law breaker.

Ignoring of course the 100+ years of immigrants coming from Europe without papers and the Chinese who help build the railroads here.

The fact is that if you are here without papers, it is of necessity means staying away from the police by obeying every law they can.  

So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way.  Economically they are a vital part of our work force and to kick them all out would not only cost a lot of money to get them out, but much of our food crops would rot in the fields.

So we need to figure out some compromise for everyone's sake.

Debunk this: Fluoride declared neurotoxin, causing an adhd and dyslexia pandemic in millions of children worldwide
-----------
Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article.

The website refers to this study: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970278-3/fulltext#article_upsell.  The paragraph on fluoride reads: ""A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable."" 

If you click on the reference 44, it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors (again, more links).  Here is selected text from the skeptics (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621182/):""Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study (Choi et al. 2012), including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of 0.4 in mean IQ is clinically negligible (Jeckel et al. 2007; Rothman et al. 2008; Szklo and Nieto 2007) even though it was statistically significant.""

So the article on the website makes a big deal about 1 paragraph in a review article (Level 5 evidence, by the way), which refers to a meta-analysis (Level 1 evidence). The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a 0.4-point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant.

TL:DR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride exposure and IQ (not dyslexia and ADHD). The data supporting this link suggest a statistically significant, but clinical unimportant, effect.  Debunked."

There's really no point in arguing that immigrants commit fewer crimes because that is not the standard being applied. The only acceptable number of immigrant crimes for conservatives is zero. An impossible standard but then that's the point. 

Someone once put it to me in relation to Syrian refugees as 'if there was a jar with 1000 jelly beans and you told me one was poisoned I wouldn't eat from the jar'.

I responded by saying: let's change the analogy so that jelly beans are people and say that one is 'poison' and of the other 999, a certain number will suffer and/or die if they're not let in. Then he started with how they're economic migrants and not in any danger so I gave up

Have you been homeless? Did you have schizophrenia?  Do you have no family members who are capable of financially taking care of you if you suddenly lose your job and have difficulty finding a new one immediately?

There are people with worse luck than you, I guarantee it. And still, even if you don't buy any of this, like I said: thinking someone should spend the rest of their life in prison for stealing belts makes you an asshole.  It just does.  That's not an appropriate punishment.

&gt;  If you keep doing the same old shit, you'll get the same old punishment.

Life in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.
-----------
Being homeless or schizophrenic doesn't give you any reason or excuse to break the law.  The law is in place no matter what your situation is.  Follow the law, and stay out of prison.  Break the law, and go to prison.  It's a choice.  Some people just made the wrong choice.

If somebody lands themselves in prison for life for continuously stealing, that was their choice.  It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested.  

&gt;Life in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.

Not if you're getting life in prison for committing the exact same crime three times.  Life in prison for repeat offenders makes sense.  Your sentence increases every time you repeat an offense, so eventually, your sentence will expire after you expire.  There's a way to avoid that, however.  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again.

[Here](https://www.google.se/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/pfricklab/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2018/04/ML-2018-Bersani-et-al-Offending-histories-of-undocumented-immigrants.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3d2GyYTbAhXDKVAKHRBmAxwQFjAAegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CcfWegQO0twtMqKMdIz96) it is.

First of all, the study was titled, ""Investigating the Offending Histories of 
Undocumented Immigrants"" Not immigrants..

Secondly, the study used self reporting to collect it's data. And the self reporting data diverged from the statistics.

&gt; Nonetheless, results show that undocumented immigrants 
generally report the lowest rate of offending prior to and following their first 
arrest. Yet despite offending less, undocumented immigrants are more likely to 
be re-arrested in the three-years following their initial contact with the justice 
system. Divergence in the pattern of results contingent upon the measure of 
criminal behavior – self-report or official arrest – warrants focused 
consideration to disentangle whether the difference is due to: systematic crime 
reporting bias (e.g., under-reporting of crime among undocumented 
immigrants), differential treatment in the criminal justice system (e.g., 
intensified policing), or a combination of factors.


Last of all, there are much better articles which source their claims.

[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/18/trumps-claim-that-immigrants-bring-tremendous-crime-is-still-wrong/?noredirect=on) has a pretty good article.

Well Trump and his ilk point out that crossing the border without papers is criminal and therefore every undocumented person is a law breaker.

Ignoring of course the 100+ years of immigrants coming from Europe without papers and the Chinese who help build the railroads here.

The fact is that if you are here without papers, it is of necessity means staying away from the police by obeying every law they can.  

So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way.  Economically they are a vital part of our work force and to kick them all out would not only cost a lot of money to get them out, but much of our food crops would rot in the fields.

So we need to figure out some compromise for everyone's sake.

&gt;Just because you've committed a crime in the past doesn't make you a ""criminal"".

Yes!  It does.  Criminals are defined by law-breaking, not by when they committed the crime.  Escaping conviction for a crime and the consequences that should result from committing crimes does not make one innocent.

Well Trump and his ilk point out that crossing the border without papers is criminal and therefore every undocumented person is a law breaker.

Ignoring of course the 100+ years of immigrants coming from Europe without papers and the Chinese who help build the railroads here.

The fact is that if you are here without papers, it is of necessity means staying away from the police by obeying every law they can.  

So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way.  Economically they are a vital part of our work force and to kick them all out would not only cost a lot of money to get them out, but much of our food crops would rot in the fields.

So we need to figure out some compromise for everyone's sake.

That's an exaggeration.  The three-strikes law only applies to persons convicted of violent crimes or serious felonies.  You can be arrested for the same misdemeanor as often as you want, that law won't apply to you.

Really?

OK: thought experiment:

&gt;Not all Immigrants.

&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.

&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.

&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.

&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.

&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:

&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.

&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?

&gt;Well, actually…

&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.

&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.

&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.

&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.

&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.

&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.

&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.

I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.

**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**

And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.

My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. 

And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.""

Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. 

Some men.

A minority of men.

A sub-population of men.

Certain kinds of men.

Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.

But not all men. 

You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. 

And on a side-note: the ""lived experiences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived experiences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.

Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.

Lived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.

I won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. 

This is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used."

I have never wantonly violated any nation's immigration laws as illegal immigrants have in the U.S.   I have also travelled to most of their countries.  If I had wantonly violated their country's immigration laws in the same way, then I would have been *as deserving* of the same expeditious deportation consequences they should face in the U.S.  You see, unlike their misguided advocates, I don't believe in legal double standards.

It is beyond disingenuous to conflate their law breaking and the consequences that result from it with other minor infractions.  Minimizing those consequences is outright fraudulent.

I'm only responding to your *exact wording* of *any criminal activity*. Wording you now seem to want to backpedal on.

Also, the majority of illegal immigrants have just overstayed visas. That happens to be considered a lesser crime than crossing the border illegally.

On top of that, illegal immigrants are great for the private sector where they struggle to employ citizens. Farm work is a big one there.

Yes!  It does.  Criminals are defined by law-breaking, not by when they committed the crime.  Escaping conviction for a crime and the consequences that should result from committing crimes does not make one innocent.

Panama is used as a major drug trafficking *port* and gets a hands-off on the worst of the violence, whereas Mexico is so large and populated that its status as a border country doesn't matter because that's where so many of the producers and their rich overlords are living. Panama is used as the clean business front. You also can't ignore the *positive* involvement of the US in Panama (overseeing the canal); we have an obvious economic interest in Panama *not* being a terrifying place because it would shit all over our trade, whereas the security of Mexico or Colombia is less of a concern for us. 


First, the way we profited by drug countries was *through* the creation and sale of drugs. Then, when those drugs are sold in the US, we profit by criminalizing them and filling the prisons with cheap labor, with the secondary ""benefit"" of disproportionately targetting people of color and other undesirables; a fine bonus for the racists in charge of policy. Fear of violence increases the production and sale of arms, both small (for the protection of the average citizen) and military-grade (in case we need another intervention). We can also sell weapons to those countries now facing the drug violence we basically bankrolled, leading to more profit. That fear also drives citizens here to vote for the political party viewed as ""tougher"" on crime, which does not create any incentive for said party to *actually* help solve the problem so long as they can keep up appearances alone. The ways by which we profit from instability in Latin America are viewed as more favorable or personally enriching by certain people in power (not just politically, but economically) than the ways we might profit if those countries were safe and our own citizens weren't addicts.

Enjoy  Freedom.    and that includes freedom to fail.   
Don't  Expect the government to take care of you and look out for your best interest.  they are only interested in money  your health and safety is the least of their concerns. 

You must take it upon yourself to eat correctly and figure out what is safe for you to use. 

walk in any major grocery store and take a look around at the people shopping there.  Something is off the rails that many large people in the same place use to be a spectacle and not the norm.  

Organic food is worth the effort and or the price. there are a few foods that will give you enough iodine. dried seaweed has the highest amount .  Things like Eggs and Cod also have iodine but not as much. 

only cook in cast iron  and store items in unleaded glass containers.
Never use plastic for anything that you consume. 

hygiene items are a major cause of high estrogen in men.  so many chemicals get cocktailed together and cause an endocrine disruption.

they make products that are safe to use but they are not sold in normal stores.   Herban Cowboy, Dessert Essentials to name a few.

Fabric softeners are bad so are most laundry soaps.   

ECOS seems to be ok .  The list just keeps going.  

if you are sick and no one can figure it out.  start with what you eat and touch every day and work your way back.  waiting on them to save you is not an option when time is as fast as it is.

Can't believe I read through it...

[Here](https://www.google.se/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/pfricklab/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2018/04/ML-2018-Bersani-et-al-Offending-histories-of-undocumented-immigrants.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3d2GyYTbAhXDKVAKHRBmAxwQFjAAegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CcfWegQO0twtMqKMdIz96) it is.

First of all, the study was titled, ""Investigating the Offending Histories of 
Undocumented Immigrants"" Not immigrants..

Secondly, the study used self reporting to collect it's data. And the self reporting data diverged from the statistics.

&gt; Nonetheless, results show that undocumented immigrants 
generally report the lowest rate of offending prior to and following their first 
arrest. Yet despite offending less, undocumented immigrants are more likely to 
be re-arrested in the three-years following their initial contact with the justice 
system. Divergence in the pattern of results contingent upon the measure of 
criminal behavior – self-report or official arrest – warrants focused 
consideration to disentangle whether the difference is due to: systematic crime 
reporting bias (e.g., under-reporting of crime among undocumented 
immigrants), differential treatment in the criminal justice system (e.g., 
intensified policing), or a combination of factors.


Last of all, there are much better articles which source their claims.

[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/18/trumps-claim-that-immigrants-bring-tremendous-crime-is-still-wrong/?noredirect=on) has a pretty good article."

I'd say the Stoned Ape Theory is more credible an explanation for the why the capacity of the human brain doubled in size over a few hundred million of years vs. just eating meat.
-----------
one tidbit of info that may be related to topic: 

the human brain is made of omega3 fatty acids. There are 3 types of omega3: ALA, EPA, and DHA. The brain is made from DHA. There is only one natural source of DHA: algae, and fish that eat algae. Walnuts, flax seeds,  etc are NOT DHA.

Many people, especially males and older people, do not convert food sources of ALA to DHA very efficiently. In these cases the body will incorporate nonDHA fatty acids into the membrane of the brain. However there is at least some evidence that this leads to suboptimal results like emotional or mood issues, attention issues, or anger issues. However the specifics are widely debated

Totally false, and ideologically inspired.  We know that, worldwide, volcanoes produce roughly 200M tons of carbon-12 on average (edit: per year).  But we measure 29 *billion* tons of carbon-12 in the atmosphere.  The only ""natural"" source of carbon-12 is.... volcanoes.  Ergo, the rest is unambiguously produced by human activity.

As touched upon by /u/villianboy, this is basically self evident when you consider the absolutely staggering number of carbon-12 producing ""things"" in the world (factories, cars, etc).

&gt; They statistically commit more crime by a huge margin. 

Source?

&gt; Not sure why this sub insists on pretending the right doesn’t like legal immigrants

Because the current administration is making legal immigration more difficult. The requirements for several of the working visa programs have changed significantly, and the ban-that-isn't-about-Muslims-but-totally-is-about-Muslims makes people not want to come here for fear of getting turned away at last minute. Many people with green cards and visas were caught up in the travel ban. There was a reason that several states sued to overturn the ban, and it's not because they love illegal immigrants.

EDIT: They also talk about ending chain migration, which is what allowed people like Trump and Pence to be in this country in the first place. They got theirs and now they want to make sure no one else has a chance.

This isn’t even debatable: https://cis.org/Camarota/NonCitizens-Committed-Disproportionate-Share-Federal-Crimes-201116


Making it easier or harder to immigrate legally has nothing to do with how someone feels about illegals, it has to do wh the economic impact that comes with adding to a population.

I have iodized salt in my pantry. I also have Himalayan pink salt. I use both.

Something for people to remember - Iodine evaporates and you are left with iodine-less salt if you leave the salt packet unsealed/open. Most of the time people think they are consuming iodine salt, they are actually just consuming salt, and the iodine is mostly gone. Buy salt regularly or keep it in a sealed container.

Edit: we've found this comment to likely be technically incorrect.

We evolved for 99.99% of our existence, prior to the invention of fire and tools, as frugivores. You can simply look at our body's digestive system and it's self-evident, just as you can look at a cow's digestive system and tell it's designed to eat grass rather than meat. Perhaps we really did live for 600+ years until people started straying from that natural diet as omnivores and thereby damaging their bodies.

Probiotics are helpful for cultivating a healthy (for you) gut flora, but make sure you're cultivating the *right* bacteria. Sourcrout, for example, contains plant-eating bacteria whereas kambucha contains sugar-eating bacteria. Dunno about you, but I don't need encouragement to eat sugar.

The sugars most people get in their diet is terrible, not just the kinds but the amounts.  I think even recently studies were suggesting that c.diff was being made worse through an alternative to sucrose.

There might be, or was at one time, humans with the right genetics to live that long but I don't really think so.

That doesn't answer my question actually. I asked what's wrong with the numbers. The report is very transparent about where their information comes from and the limits of what the information can tell us. The fact that white supremacist use the same source has nothing to do with whether the source is credible or not.

&gt;This report demonstrates the difficulty in trying to come to any conclusion about the extent of immigrant criminality. Problems with data collection and contrary results characterize information about the link between immigrants and crime.

For starters, lets look at the definition of neurotoxin:

&gt;Neurotoxins are substances that are poisonous or destructive to nerve tissue. Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue.

To say that fluoride is a a neurotoxin, but it *only* causes ADHD and dyslexia is suspect as fuck.

The report I linked doesn't ""create numbers"" at all. They get them from DHS and other state agencies. Actually read the thing, and you will see that it doesn't even make any claims about immigration and crime as the information that is available is incomplete and sometimes contradictory.

Deportation is the outcome that should apply to those who willingly overstay their visas in an effort to violate U.S. immigration laws.  Does this make them criminals?  It does to the extent they have broken the nation's immigration laws with malice of forethought.

You are most definitely engaging in legalistic hairsplitting with that argument.  It is both disingenuous and fraudulent.  Crime and criminals are defined by law violations.

B12 isn't made in meat.

It's supplemented in the diet of farm Animals so everyone doesn't end up B12 deficient.

B12 is actually a bacteria that exists in the dirt but due to industrial agriculture gets destroyed by pesticides. If you were a frugivores under natural conditions you wouldn't have a B12 deficiency.

This isn’t even debatable: https://cis.org/Camarota/NonCitizens-Committed-Disproportionate-Share-Federal-Crimes-201116


Making it easier or harder to immigrate legally has nothing to do with how someone feels about illegals, it has to do wh the economic impact that comes with adding to a population. There’s an excellent lecture called ‘Immigration by numbers’, I’d be interested in your feedback. https://youtu.be/LPjzfGChGlE

&gt; This isn’t even debatable: https://cis.org/Camarota/NonCitizens-Committed-Disproportionate-Share-Federal-Crimes-201116

I don't trust their data because I found factual errors in it already. They claim 21.9% of Money Laundering/Racketeering convictions were for non-citizens, but the USSC data shows 33.8% for Money Laundering and 11.9% for Racketeering (separate categories) and I can't see how they get 21.9% from that. Their numbers for sex offenses and homicides don't match up either. The numbers for auto theft are double what USSC has listed. Find a better, less biased source that isn't associated with white nationalists.

&gt; Making it easier or harder to immigrate legally has nothing to do with how someone feels about illegals, it has to do wh the economic impact that comes with adding to a population.

The right uses their supposed hatred of illegals as an cover for their general xenophobia. They want to keep *everyone* out, so they harp on illegal immigration to keep people distracted while they also cut back on legal immigration. The fact of the matter is that we *need* the millions of extra workers that legal and illegal immigration provides to keep our economy running.

&gt;This would mean, of course, that there would have been millions of creatures during that time that would be “in between,” as amphibians evolved into reptiles. Evidence of these “transitional forms,” as they are called, should be abundant. 

Firstly, no scientist expects fossil evidence to be ""abundant."" [Fossilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil#Fossilization_processes) is something which happens extremely rarely. An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils. But the fossil record is by it's nature incomplete. 

Secondly, there are plenty of examples of transitional fossils. However, these are also examples of unique species. Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a ""transitional form"" between A and C. However, the standard response of creationists is then to ask ""Where's the transitional form between A and B?""

1	1268	dz08rnx	6	comment	comment	0.86	"Face facts: Immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born peers
-----------
I read them. Your first quote describes the feelings and opinions that first generation youth have toward the legal system \(it states nothing about actual crime rate\). Your second quote is taken from the 'Objective' section of the research article \(which serves to provide context for the current research being performed\), here the author is stating a claim, in this case he is citing his own research in the 2014 study, this is not the conclusion statement of the research article.  All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations. 

[Here](https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/pfricklab/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2018/04/ML-2018-Bersani-et-al-Offending-histories-of-undocumented-immigrants.pdf) is the actual, full Migration Letters study that is cited in the news article. From p. 14 Discussion \(my commentary in brackets\): 

First, consistent with previous research, self\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \(i.e., first arrest\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\-born peers. \[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\] 

Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\-years following first arrest. \[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\] 

Third, and in contrast to the findings for self\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\-arrested and are re\-arrested more in the three\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\] 
-----------
Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that.

You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. 

In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past.

To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc.

That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior.

Not only do they ask fact\-based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told.

In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: 

&gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest""

Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: 

&gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self\-reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**""

So what exactly is wrong with their methodology again?

There is NO OTHER WAY to determine if someone UNDOCUMENTED has been arrested without first asking."

I agree but in my experience there are far more brands of non-iodized versus what should be the standard iodized with just a few non's. /shrug
-----------
Because most ""fancy"" salt or salt meant for a specific purpose isn't iodized. You only really find general purpose table salt and some sea salt to be iodized. 

But again, that makes sense. People who buy their fancy Himalayan pink salt don't want added iodine because they want the pure ""natural"" chemicals or whatever. People who bake with salt don't general want added iodine because it can impart an off flavor when baked. Same for people who want to do brines. And so on. 

 Never the less, 90% of the salt sold is the cheap table salt variety which does contain iodine. The number of products does not tell you what people buy. There is only one cheapest brand of anything, and yet most people will buy that. We have options to buy both easily because there are good reasons to buy both. That is a good thing. 

In general, the more choices you have the better. If the government starts a smear campaign against iodized salt, sure. Or if you find it impossible to buy iodized salt or other iodine supplements all of a sudden than sure. But the fact that we have a choice is not a cause for worry.

By no means an I an expert on this, so please take this reply with a grain of salt.

The lead in municipal water supplies is not added, it comes from the water pipes themselves.  Most cities main water pipes were constructed 50 - 100+ years ago and contain a large amount of lead.. even homes built before 1986 may contain lead pipes and lead solder.  As the pipes corrode lead enters the water supply.

The biggest difference between ingesting lead and fluoride is fluoride is water soluble lead is not.  So your body will get rid of fluoride (like it does with most things you ingest), lead on the other hand is a heavy metal and your body has no way of dealing with it.  Over time, the lead builds up in our system causing toxicity  This is known as bioaccumulation.

&gt; This isn’t even debatable: https://cis.org/Camarota/NonCitizens-Committed-Disproportionate-Share-Federal-Crimes-201116

I don't trust their data because I found factual errors in it already. They claim 21.9% of Money Laundering/Racketeering convictions were for non-citizens, but the USSC data shows 33.8% for Money Laundering and 11.9% for Racketeering (separate categories) and I can't see how they get 21.9% from that. Their numbers for sex offenses and homicides don't match up either. The numbers for auto theft are double what USSC has listed. Find a better, less biased source that isn't associated with white nationalists.

&gt; Making it easier or harder to immigrate legally has nothing to do with how someone feels about illegals, it has to do wh the economic impact that comes with adding to a population.

The right uses their supposed hatred of illegals as an cover for their general xenophobia. They want to keep *everyone* out, so they harp on illegal immigration to keep people distracted while they also cut back on legal immigration. The fact of the matter is that we *need* the millions of extra workers that legal and illegal immigration provides to keep our economy running.

&gt; There’s an excellent lecture called ‘Immigration by numbers’, I’d be interested in your feedback. https://youtu.be/LPjzfGChGlE

This has nothing to do with the situation at hand.

If the government loved us they would hand out free Vit C and worry about iodine levels. 

Instead, like an abusive partner, they dump nero-toxins in the drinking water and allow chemicals no on can pronounce into the food.

You know, maybe the government doesn't love us.

-----------
Being homeless or schizophrenic doesn't give you any reason or excuse to break the law.  The law is in place no matter what your situation is.  Follow the law, and stay out of prison.  Break the law, and go to prison.  It's a choice.  Some people just made the wrong choice.

If somebody lands themselves in prison for life for continuously stealing, that was their choice.  It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested.  

&gt;Life in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.

Not if you're getting life in prison for committing the exact same crime three times.  Life in prison for repeat offenders makes sense.  Your sentence increases every time you repeat an offense, so eventually, your sentence will expire after you expire.  There's a way to avoid that, however.  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again.  
-----------
Being homeless doesn't give you a reason to break the law?  What?  How do you eat when you don't have a job?  Panhandling is illegal, people won't give you work...it makes sense that people resort to theft. Doesn't make it right, but a man's gotta eat.

I would also disagree with you that some schizophrenics are making a choice to break the law. Some of these people have lost touch with reality.

&gt;  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again. 

That's a really nice thought.  Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening.  

Look, I get the whole ""you keep doing this, we're going to make it worse on you until you stop."" But there's a whoooole lot of room between a year in prison for minor theft and the rest of your life. Sentence someone to five years, ten years.  Hell, sentence them to thirty years and that's probably *still* less than life in prison. Thirty years! For stealing three belts! Who's heartless enough to do that to a person? After thirty years your old life would be unrecognizable.  It doesn't make sense to punish someone that long because they're not even the same person they were when they committed the crime. Life in prison is *worse* than that.

&gt; It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested. 

It does matter that you agree with that decision, because these laws won't change until most people change their minds about stuff like this.  And until then, these people will be *bigger* drains on society because, like we both agreed on, it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff."

You’re creating a straw man by insinuating the Democrats advocate “open-borders” in policy. You refuse to address that because you know your insinuation is false. Or maybe it’s willful ignorance. Regardless, you’re wrong.

And don’t red-hats hate when people misconstrue dumb things they do or say? Like, when Trump retweeted those far-right anti-Islam videos, red-hats argued that they didn’t really reflect some policy belief for Trump.

Also, not sure who you’re quoting when you quote “open borders”.  I never said the words open borders.  You did.  I wasn’t the one creating the strawman.  You are.

I have iodized salt in my pantry. I also have Himalayan pink salt. I use both.

Something for people to remember - Iodine evaporates and you are left with iodine-less salt if you leave the salt packet unsealed/open.

You should give a shit.  Turning a blind eye to wanton violations of U.S. laws is a slippery slope not worth stepping onto.  Would you turn a blind eye to attacks against the illegal immigrant community once the American people lose their patience over this ongoing crime?  The country can turn a blind eye to that as well.

I have no tolerance for any criminal activity whatsoever.  Illegal immigration is not an inconsequential crime

That's because you've been tricked by the author and researcher, not me.

Costa Rica is a pretty nice place to live. 

 Except for that island off the coast with the runaway dinosaurs. /s

Panama has improved so much that it is giving the Cayman Islands a run for hiding rich people's money from progressive governments.

Panama is used as a major drug trafficking *port* and gets a hands-off on the worst of the violence, whereas Mexico is so large and populated that its status as a border country doesn't matter because that's where so many of the producers and their rich overlords are living. Panama is used as the clean business front. You also can't ignore the *positive* involvement of the US in Panama (overseeing the canal); we have an obvious economic interest in Panama *not* being a terrifying place because it would shit all over our trade, whereas the security of Mexico or Colombia is less of a concern for us. 


First, the way we profited by drug countries was *through* the creation and sale of drugs. Then, when those drugs are sold in the US, we profit by criminalizing them and filling the prisons with cheap labor, with the secondary ""benefit"" of disproportionately targetting people of color and other undesirables; a fine bonus for the racists in charge of policy. Fear of violence increases the production and sale of arms, both small (for the protection of the average citizen) and military-grade (in case we need another intervention). We can also sell weapons to those countries now facing the drug violence we basically bankrolled, leading to more profit. That fear also drives citizens here to vote for the political party viewed as ""tougher"" on crime, which does not create any incentive for said party to *actually* help solve the problem so long as they can keep up appearances alone. The ways by which we profit from instability in Latin America are viewed as more favorable or personally enriching by certain people in power (not just politically, but economically) than the ways we might profit if those countries were safe and our own citizens weren't addicts."

I have iodized salt in my pantry. I also have Himalayan pink salt. I use both.

Something for people to remember - Iodine evaporates and you are left with iodine-less salt if you leave the salt packet unsealed/open. Most of the time people think they are consuming iodine salt, they are actually just consuming salt, and the iodine is mostly gone. Buy salt regularly or keep it in a sealed container."

Let them dictate to us insomuch that it is universally wrong to brutalize people? We cannot terrorize people regardless of national origin. We can find a middle ground that secures our borders and incentivizes becoming a well-naturalized citizen,

And there is no such thing as dehumanizing oneself besides committing heinous crimes. Brutalization is a symptom of authoritative abuses.

Debunk this: Fluoride declared neurotoxin, causing an adhd and dyslexia pandemic in millions of children worldwide

One thing ""scare articles"" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes remove fluoride instead of adding it. 

The whole thing came about as a result of a condition called ""texas teeth"".  Folks in some areas developed unsightly brown stains on their teeth, but those same stained chompers showed marked decreases in decay.  The cause was the naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the water.  Research was done to find a happy medium between strong teeth and brown ones, and a sort of national standard was picked.  So in some spots the water treatment includes *removing it* instead of adding it.  Shutting down all fluoridation treatment would also shut down this protection.

I'm sure in high enough doses you could hurt yourself with fluoride.  At high enough doses you can hurt yourself with water.  However even if you're drinking water from an unregulated well in an area with high natural fluoride in it you're unlikely to be harmed by it.

My mother was a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII when fluoride simply wasn't available.  My aunt lost all her teeth as a teenager.  My mother kept hers but doesn't have one without serious dental work in it.  Mine aren't perfect but a LONG way from either of those scenarios.  My childhood was soaked in fluoride, both from school ""treatment"" programs and at home in the form of toothpastes.  I may be a bit nerdy but I don't think I've suffered neurological trauma from it."

The whole article is full of lies. 

Here is some real information: 

* The Department of Homeland Security \(DHS\) estimates that immigrants \(legal and illegal\) comprise 20 percent of inmates in prisons and jails. The foreign\-born are 15.4 percent of the nation’s adult population. However, DHS has not provided a detailed explanation of how the estimates were generated.

* The Federal Bureau of Prisons reports that 26.4 percent of inmates in federal prisons are non\-U.S. citizens. Non\-citizens are 8.6 percent of the nation’s adult population. However, federal prisons are not representative of prisons generally or local jails.

We evolved as omnivores, but I do agree with you that people don't run great on bad diets.  I don't think it's just malnutrition that is the culprit because the more I learn about gut flora the more I think that maybe some of the stuff in our diet is feeding the wrong bacteria inside of us.

Probiotics are helpful for cultivating a healthy (for you) gut flora, but make sure you're cultivating the *right* bacteria.

So they are a group who opposes illegal immigration and wants to reduce the number of people living in the United States illegally. That seems pretty reasonable to me. It used to be something Republicans and Democrats agreed on. 
And the SPLC has no credibility with me. They routinely lump in regular conservative voices (or even liberals like Steven Pinker or Sam Harris) with Alt-Right or Nazi groups. It's a joke.

It can. There is regular theft that is a misdemeanor if it's under $1,000. Higher than that is grand larceny. Then there is robbery which falls into several categories.

As to your question though, there are white-collar crimes like embezzlement, fraud, bribery, racketeering, Ponzi schemes, etc. Depending on the seriousness, the judge, and a myriad of other factors, someone can get life sentences or longer for these kinds of crimes.

Plenty of states have three-strikes laws that do not just apply to violent crimes or serious felonies. Many of these folks should be locked away.  But the fact that there are relatively harmless folks who have been deprived of a normal life and a chance to be a regular citizen is no exaggeration.

[ACLU report on 3,200 non-violent offenders sentenced to life without parole in the US.](https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/111813-lwop-complete-report.pdf#page=4) Some of those crimes included things like:

* attempting to cash a stolen check 
* a junk-dealer’s possession of stolen junk metal (10 valves and one elbow pipe)
* possession of stolen wrenches 
* siphoning gasoline from a truck 
* stealing tools from a tool shed and a welding machine from a yard 
* shoplifting three belts from a department store 
* shoplifting several digital cameras 
* shoplifting two jerseys from an athletic store 
* taking a television, circular saw, and a power converter from a vacant house 
* breaking into a closed liquor store in the middle of the night

Well Trump and his ilk point out that crossing the border without papers is criminal and therefore every undocumented person is a law breaker.

Ignoring of course the 100+ years of immigrants coming from Europe without papers and the Chinese who help build the railroads here.

The fact is that if you are here without papers, it is of necessity means staying away from the police by obeying every law they can.  

So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way.  Economically they are a vital part of our work force and to kick them all out would not only cost a lot of money to get them out, but much of our food crops would rot in the fields.

So we need to figure out some compromise for everyone's sake.

The most recent Latin American leader deposed by the US was Noriega, not exactly a social democrat, in Panama in 1989.

20 years after we dropped nuclear bombs on Japan, the Japanese were selling us Datsuns and Sonys.

20 years after we firebombed Germany, West Germany was importing guest workers.  

When are the democracies in Latin America going to get their acts together?  What incentive do they have to do so?

Try looking at the stark differences in the economic and fiscal consequences caused by smoking weed vs illegal immigration.  That's what you're missing.  Illegal immigration is far from being inconsequential.

You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

&gt; They statistically commit more crime by a huge margin. 

Source?

&gt; Not sure why this sub insists on pretending the right doesn’t like legal immigrants

Because the current administration is making legal immigration more difficult. The requirements for several of the working visa programs have changed significantly, and the ban-that-isn't-about-Muslims-but-totally-is-about-Muslims makes people not want to come here for fear of getting turned away at last minute. Many people with green cards and visas were caught up in the travel ban. There was a reason that several states sued to overturn the ban, and it's not because they love illegal immigrants.

EDIT: They also talk about ending chain migration, which is what allowed people like Trump and Pence to be in this country in the first place. They got theirs and now they want to make sure no one else has a chance.

There's really no point in arguing that immigrants commit fewer crimes because that is not the standard being applied. The only acceptable number of immigrant crimes for conservatives is zero. An impossible standard but then that's the point. 

Someone once put it to me in relation to Syrian refugees as 'if there was a jar with 1000 jelly beans and you told me one was poisoned I wouldn't eat from the jar'.

I'd say more likely, his videos on topics that are outside of the hard sciences, he is pretty bad/obnoxious. Namely his videos against feminism and the few that he actually goes at the bible, on it's own merits, as well as the videos he attempts to interview/debate. He tends to do far worse at proving his points, say things in ways that provoke more than educate. Even when I agree with his concept, his style and terrible points, make me wish I didn't.

IMO thunderf00t is still one of the best at attacking psudo-science, with actual science, but he often comes into topics he doesn't know as well, with the same confidence as he has in the subjects he is actually good at.

Your title says that iodine is absent from almost all salts, but the article says that it is added to almost all salts. Did you not even read the article you posted?

Well the article is wrong because if you go to any grocery store near you, check out literally 90% of the brands that sell salt. They will have somewhere on the label that says, ""does not contain iodide, a necessary nutrient."" Almost every form of table salt in any restaurant and the most popular brand, Morton's does not contain iodide. This is as easily verifiable as going to the store. My parents have 4 different types of salt in their house, my grandparents have 3 different types and not one of them contain iodide. I was surprised this was the case because that's literally the whole point of salt, to supply iodide. 

I use (actual) Himalayan pink salt, and Mediterranean sea salt. Both contain not only iodide but a bunch of other naturally-occurring minerals as well. I also take one drop of sublingual iodine every morning which helps the functions of your thyroid gland. Thyroid is one of the glands located at the throat chakra and in the last 6-8 months I've taken it, I've noticed a drastic increase in my ability to communicate my ideas.

You are simply incorrect, my friend.

Read the ABSTRACT in both journals, they lay out precisely what the study is all about.

""Results show that, compared with second-generation and native-born youth, first-generation youth tend to have more positive views toward the law, less cynical attitudes toward the legal system, and report more social costs associated with punishment.""

""Mounting evidence reveals that foreign-born, first generation immigrants have significantly lower levels of criminal involvement compared to their US-born, second and third-plus generation peers.""

They are based on the same Alex R. Piquero who is mentioned in OP's link.


-----------
I read them. Your first quote describes the feelings and opinions that first generation youth have toward the legal system \(it states nothing about actual crime rate\). Your second quote is taken from the 'Objective' section of the research article \(which serves to provide context for the current research being performed\), here the author is stating a claim, in this case he is citing his own research in the 2014 study, this is not the conclusion statement of the research article.  All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations. 

[Here](https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/pfricklab/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2018/04/ML-2018-Bersani-et-al-Offending-histories-of-undocumented-immigrants.pdf) is the actual, full Migration Letters study that is cited in the news article. From p. 14 Discussion \(my commentary in brackets\): 

First, consistent with previous research, self\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \(i.e., first arrest\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\-born peers. \[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\] 

Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\-years following first arrest. \[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\] 

Third, and in contrast to the findings for self\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\-arrested and are re\-arrested more in the three\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\] "	"[CLS] face facts : immigrants commit fewer crimes than u . s . - born peers [ e ##os ] you are simply incorrect , my friend .

Enjoy  Freedom.    and that includes freedom to fail.   
Don't  Expect the government to take care of you and look out for your best interest.  they are only interested in money  your health and safety is the least of their concerns. 

You must take it upon yourself to eat correctly and figure out what is safe for you to use. 

walk in any major grocery store and take a look around at the people shopping there.  Something is off the rails that many large people in the same place use to be a spectacle and not the norm.  

Organic food is worth the effort and or the price. there are a few foods that will give you enough iodine. dried seaweed has the highest amount .  Things like Eggs and Cod also have iodine but not as much. 

only cook in cast iron  and store items in unleaded glass containers.
Never use plastic for anything that you consume. 

hygiene items are a major cause of high estrogen in men.  so many chemicals get cocktailed together and cause an endocrine disruption.

they make products that are safe to use but they are not sold in normal stores.   Herban Cowboy, Dessert Essentials to name a few.

Fabric softeners are bad so are most laundry soaps.   

ECOS seems to be ok .  The list just keeps going.  

if you are sick and no one can figure it out.  start with what you eat and touch every day and work your way back.  waiting on them to save you is not an option when time is as fast as it is.

The whole article is full of lies. 

Here is some real information: 

* The Department of Homeland Security \(DHS\) estimates that immigrants \(legal and illegal\) comprise 20 percent of inmates in prisons and jails. The foreign\-born are 15.4 percent of the nation’s adult population. However, DHS has not provided a detailed explanation of how the estimates were generated.

* The Federal Bureau of Prisons reports that 26.4 percent of inmates in federal prisons are non\-U.S. citizens. Non\-citizens are 8.6 percent of the nation’s adult population. However, federal prisons are not representative of prisons generally or local jails.

&gt;All salt samples lost iodine over the 12-month sampling period. Losses ranged from less than 10% to 100% of the original iodine in the sample (from a starting value of 50 mg of iodine per gram of salt + 5%). The rate of iodate loss was influenced by the salt’s origin and composition, the packaging material, and the relative humidity during storage.

http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/food/V193e/ch06.htm

It's an acquired taste, but dulce flakes are a very good source of iodine. I remember like 3 years ago someone on this sub was recommending we eat dulce flakes. I found some at the health food store, so that's probably where you'll also find some. I buy a new package of flakes every month, which I think is like 6 bucks.

Well the article is wrong because if you go to any grocery store near you, check out literally 90% of the brands that sell salt. They will have somewhere on the label that says, ""does not contain iodide, a necessary nutrient."" Almost every form of table salt in any restaurant and the most popular brand, Morton's does not contain iodide. This is as easily verifiable as going to the store. My parents have 4 different types of salt in their house, my grandparents have 3 different types and not one of them contain iodide. I was surprised this was the case because that's literally the whole point of salt, to supply iodide. 

I use (actual) Himalayan pink salt, and Mediterranean sea salt. Both contain not only iodide but a bunch of other naturally-occurring minerals as well. I also take one drop of sublingual iodine every morning which helps the functions of your thyroid gland. Thyroid is one of the glands located at the throat chakra and in the last 6-8 months I've taken it, I've noticed a drastic increase in my ability to communicate my ideas. I always used to have a problem with this as an adult up until recently. 

It's definitely a crisis. At least in the US.

Because the current administration is making legal immigration more difficult. The requirements for several of the working visa programs have changed significantly, and the ban-that-isn't-about-Muslims-but-totally-is-about-Muslims makes people not want to come here for fear of getting turned away at last minute. Many people with green cards and visas were caught up in the travel ban. There was a reason that several states sued to overturn the ban, and it's not because they love illegal immigrants.

Yep.  As immigration enforcement increases fewer crimes are reported:

&gt;""...Hispanics reporting sexual assault have dropped nearly 43 percent in the first three months of this year, compared to last year. And the number of Hispanic\-reported robberies and aggravated assaults are each down 12 percent.""

\([article](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/25/529513771/new-immigration-crackdowns-creating-chilling-effect-on-crime-reporting) refers to Houston, TX\) 

Immigrants and Native born Latinos in general are less likely to report crime:

&gt;""A recent survey of 715 advocates and attorneys from 46 states and the District of Columbia indicated that 78 percent of sexual and domestic violence survivors who are immigrants expressed concerns about contacting the police.""  
&gt;  
&gt;•  44 percent of Latinos surveyed reported they are less likely to contact police officers if they have been the victim of a crime because they fear that police officers will use this interaction as an opportunity to inquire into their immigration status or that of people they know.  
&gt;  
&gt;•  45 percent of Latinos stated that they are less likely to voluntarily offer information about crimes, and 45 percent are less likely to report a crime because they are afraid the police will ask them or people they know about their immigration status.  
&gt;  
&gt;•  70 percent of undocumented immigrants reported they are less likely to contact law enforcement authorities if they were victims of a crime.""

I've not done any research on this, but my 2 cents:

In the UK (where I live), there are high-flouride areas in the North (where I happened to grow up), and low-flouride areas in the South.

Dentists recognised long ago that there was a regional difference in oral health that exactly matched the natural differences in flouride levels in the local water supplies.

&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages. They only uncover dead dinosaurs (i.e., their bones), and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are. The idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists’ story about the past. No scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age. In fact, there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old

This is simply not true. The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum) in which the fossils were found. The only working explanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years (before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth.) By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed.

You can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about 50,000 years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain (volcanic) strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is 80 million years old, and below a stratum you know is 60 million years old, that fossil must be between 60 and 80 million years old.

Let them dictate to us insomuch that it is universally wrong to brutalize people? We cannot terrorize people regardless of national origin. We can find a middle ground that secures our borders and incentivizes becoming a well-naturalized citizen,

And there is no such thing as dehumanizing oneself besides committing heinous crimes. Brutalization is a symptom of authoritative abuses.

Moreover, part of the issue is that the line is broken. People get mixed messages from different immigration departments, forms take years to go through, and any mistake is met with overly-severe consequences.

Why wait in line if the line never moves?

So they are a group who opposes illegal immigration and wants to reduce the number of people living in the United States illegally. That seems pretty reasonable to me. It used to be something Republicans and Democrats agreed on. 
And the SPLC has no credibility with me. They routinely lump in regular conservative voices (or even liberals like Steven Pinker or Sam Harris) with Alt-Right or Nazi groups. It's a joke.
-----------
The only joke is you and your source that ADMITS it has an inherent bias and works according to it: ""The Center for Immigration Studies is a non-profit organization ""that favors far lower immigration numbers and produces research to further those views.""

https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-immigration-studies-cis/

QUESTIONABLE SOURCE
A questionable source exhibits one or more of the following: extreme bias, overt propaganda, poor or no sourcing to credible information and/or is fake news. Fake News is the deliberate attempt to publish hoaxes and/or disinformation for the purpose of profit or influence (Learn More). Sources listed in the Questionable Category may be very untrustworthy and should be fact checked on a per article basis. Please note sources on this list are not considered fake news unless specifically written in the notes section for that source. See all Questionable sources.

Bias: Extreme Right, Hate Group

Notes: The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a non-profit research organization “that favors far lower immigration numbers and produces research to further those views.” It was started as a spin-off from John Tanton’s Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) in 1985. Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The organization has also drawn criticism for its financial and intellectual ties to extremist racists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in 2002 and 2009 connecting CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and NumbersUSA, and showing he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation (SPLC). Bottom line, this is a hate group. (2/8/2017)

http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/mar/22/center-immigration-studies-hate-group-southern-pov/

Speaking from an outside perspective (UK)The SPLC has done it's due dilligence in this matter, from the politifact link alone I would agree with their sentiment.

Your problem is that you are ignoring the fact that conservwtive views
Are being espoused by the alt-right and neo-nazi/KKK crowd, after all david duke endorsed trump, the alt-right and tge neo-nazis and the KKK follow a conservative ideology and believe that conservative policy will bring about their version of the U.S (the 1850's social mess, pre suffrage or civil rights movement or a white ethnostate, with P.O.C and minorites expelled or enslaved).

If you don't want them coopting your platform, chsnge your platform how hard is it to not want to treat women, P.O.C and minorities like shit? You have neo-nazis running for office in the conservative party (GOP, illinois, california, minnesota/michigan). The current GOP platform gives a voice to these types of hate and extreme views, call your rep, ask to denounce them at least, put some fucking effort in.

""Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement""

Most people agree with the sentiment by the sounds of it. I disagree with your assessment on sam harris (borderline religious lunatic was my first impression), pinker keeps railing on about 'enlighenment' and comes across as Pompous twat with his head up his own arse, he may be a psychologist and a harvard graduate but he rants about nothing like a motherfucker.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_left (the term itself is a giant red flag, a conservative 'buzzword' used soley as a broad brush)

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qmg5giUaR-c

I would say that while he espouses some more left-leaning points, harris is more at home in the pseudo-intallectual crowd, he talks a big game and falls short, but people just insist he is 'genuine'.

Ignoring of course the 100+ years of immigrants coming from Europe without papers and the Chinese who help build the railroads here.

The fact is that if you are here without papers, it is of necessity means staying away from the police by obeying every law they can.  

So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way.  Economically they are a vital part of our work force and to kick them all out would not only cost a lot of money to get them out, but much of our food crops would rot in the fields.

So we need to figure out some compromise for everyone's sake.

Anti-immigration folks love to point out how many illegals are in prison, but they fail to mention that they're in prison for immigration violations. Duh.

It's an acquired taste, but dulce flakes are a very good source of iodine. I remember like 3 years ago someone on this sub was recommending we eat dulce flakes.

-----------
You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals' - they're in violation of a laws that aren't enforced properly, and the lack of enforcement creates a humanitarian issue of sending people back to countries where they might not even speak the native language.
-----------
&gt;You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. 

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter.  Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up.  Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings.  Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.

&gt;I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals'...

Why not?  It's what they willingly chose to be in life...outlaws.  Would you allow a misguided sense of political correctness keep you from calling a murderer, thief, embezzler, or con man a criminal too?  That defies logic and reason.

Do you know what actually caused millions of illegal immigrants to flee from Mexico to the U.S.?  Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to  benefit a select few from NAFTA.

It's clear from the snopes article that this meme is paraphrasing a particular claim by a particular author, and it's fully addressed in the article. 

It estimates the yearly output of all volcanoes to be about 550mtons per year, whereas human output about 35,000 mtons per year. That accounts for several hounded active volcanoes.

So that should give OP enough numbers to do some back of the envelope calculations of he really wanted to answer that question, but I don't think that's what he wanted to know. I think you're giving an over-literal interpretation of his words, without taking into account what he likely meant to say.

Also even if that is indeed what he meant, it's kinda a silly thing to ask. We have the co2 records going back millions of years, from measuring  trapped air bubbles in stone. We've seen co2 get really high, then get lower as plants sequestered it as hydrocarbons. It's all over the place. So it isn't really relevant to ask what the co2 output of a volcano is, because it never really had enough of an impact historically to really be a relevant factor. I. E. if it was highly impactfull, our planet would already be much warmer because volcanos have been around a long time.

1	1080	d1rli1y	2	comment	comment	0.94	"Debunk this: Fluoride declared neurotoxin, causing an adhd and dyslexia pandemic in millions of children worldwide
-----------
Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article.

The website refers to this study: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970278-3/fulltext#article_upsell.  The paragraph on fluoride reads: ""A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable."" 

If you click on the reference 44, it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors (again, more links).  Here is selected text from the skeptics (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621182/):""Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study (Choi et al. 2012), including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of 0.4 in mean IQ is clinically negligible (Jeckel et al. 2007; Rothman et al. 2008; Szklo and Nieto 2007) even though it was statistically significant.""

So the article on the website makes a big deal about 1 paragraph in a review article (Level 5 evidence, by the way), which refers to a meta-analysis (Level 1 evidence). The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a 0.4-point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant.

TL:DR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride exposure and IQ (not dyslexia and ADHD). The data supporting this link suggest a statistically significant, but clinical unimportant, effect.  Debunked.

Well Trump and his ilk point out that crossing the border without papers is criminal and therefore every undocumented person is a law breaker.

Ignoring of course the 100+ years of immigrants coming from Europe without papers and the Chinese who help build the railroads here.

The fact is that if you are here without papers, it is of necessity means staying away from the police by obeying every law they can.  

So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way.

&gt;You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. 

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter.  Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up.  Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings.  Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.

&gt;I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals'...

Why not?  It's what they willingly chose to be in life...outlaws.  Would you allow a misguided sense of political correctness keep you from calling a murderer, thief, embezzler, or con man a criminal too?  That defies logic and reason.

Do you know what actually caused millions of illegal immigrants to flee from Mexico to the U.S.?  Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to  benefit a select few from NAFTA.  Care to guess where U.S. manufacturing and the jobs they once provided went shortly thereafter?  Mexico.  So, in what universe is it the American people's responsibility to clean up Mexico's idiocy or pad U.S. oligarchs pockets?  It's not at all on both ends of this problem.

Yep.  As immigration enforcement increases fewer crimes are reported:

&gt;""...Hispanics reporting sexual assault have dropped nearly 43 percent in the first three months of this year, compared to last year. And the number of Hispanic\-reported robberies and aggravated assaults are each down 12 percent.""

\([article](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/25/529513771/new-immigration-crackdowns-creating-chilling-effect-on-crime-reporting) refers to Houston, TX\) 

Immigrants and Native born Latinos in general are less likely to report crime:

&gt;""A recent survey of 715 advocates and attorneys from 46 states and the District of Columbia indicated that 78 percent of sexual and domestic violence survivors who are immigrants expressed concerns about contacting the police.""  
&gt;  
&gt;•  44 percent of Latinos surveyed reported they are less likely to contact police officers if they have been the victim of a crime because they fear that police officers will use this interaction as an opportunity to inquire into their immigration status or that of people they know.  
&gt;  
&gt;•  45 percent of Latinos stated that they are less likely to voluntarily offer information about crimes, and 45 percent are less likely to report a crime because they are afraid the police will ask them or people they know about their immigration status.  
&gt;  
&gt;•  70 percent of undocumented immigrants reported they are less likely to contact law enforcement authorities if they were victims of a crime.""

It can. There is regular theft that is a misdemeanor if it's under $1,000. Higher than that is grand larceny. Then there is robbery which falls into several categories.

As to your question though, there are white-collar crimes like embezzlement, fraud, bribery, racketeering, Ponzi schemes, etc. Depending on the seriousness, the judge, and a myriad of other factors, someone can get life sentences or longer for these kinds of crimes. Some countries punish white-collar crime with death sentences as well.

[serious] Man and dinosaurs lived at the same time.

The others have given good answers, and I would like to add http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Answers_in_Genesis to the mix.

But over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought:

1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.

2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.

3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.

4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback.

So, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...

a) We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.

b) It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward.

c) The bible literalists are wrong.

Personally, I'm leaning towards 'c' as the most likely answer."	[CLS] [ serious ] man and dinosaurs lived at the same time . [ e ##os ] [ serious ] man and dinosaurs lived at the same time .

I have never wantonly violated any nation's immigration laws as illegal immigrants have in the U.S.   I have also travelled to most of their countries.  If I had wantonly violated their country's immigration laws in the same way, then I would have been *as deserving* of the same expeditious deportation consequences they should face in the U.S.  You see, unlike their misguided advocates, I don't believe in legal double standards.

Well the article is wrong because if you go to any grocery store near you, check out literally 90% of the brands that sell salt. They will have somewhere on the label that says, ""does not contain iodide, a necessary nutrient."" Almost every form of table salt in any restaurant and the most popular brand, Morton's does not contain iodide. This is as easily verifiable as going to the store. My parents have 4 different types of salt in their house, my grandparents have 3 different types and not one of them contain iodide. I was surprised this was the case because that's literally the whole point of salt, to supply iodide. 

I use (actual) Himalayan pink salt, and Mediterranean sea salt. Both contain not only iodide but a bunch of other naturally-occurring minerals as well. I also take one drop of sublingual iodine every morning which helps the functions of your thyroid gland. Thyroid is one of the glands located at the throat chakra and in the last 6-8 months I've taken it, I've noticed a drastic increase in my ability to communicate my ideas. I always used to have a problem with this as an adult up until recently. 

It's definitely a crisis. At least in the US.
-----------
This is literally not true at all.

You can pick iodized or plain salt. They'll be be right next to each other on the shelf. Iodized Morton's has a big yellow ""Iodized"" label across the front of it. 

Iodide has to be added to salt. So if you're getting some whole foods hippie-ass sea salt they might not have added iodide to be more ""natural."""

I have iodized salt in my pantry. I also have Himalayan pink salt. I use both.

Something for people to remember - Iodine evaporates and you are left with iodine-less salt if you leave the salt packet unsealed/open.

-----------
Being homeless doesn't give you a reason to break the law?  What?  How do you eat when you don't have a job?  Panhandling is illegal, people won't give you work...it makes sense that people resort to theft. Doesn't make it right, but a man's gotta eat.

I would also disagree with you that some schizophrenics are making a choice to break the law. Some of these people have lost touch with reality.

&gt;  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again. 

That's a really nice thought.  Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening.  

Look, I get the whole ""you keep doing this, we're going to make it worse on you until you stop."" But there's a whoooole lot of room between a year in prison for minor theft and the rest of your life. Sentence someone to five years, ten years.  Hell, sentence them to thirty years and that's probably *still* less than life in prison. Thirty years! For stealing three belts! Who's heartless enough to do that to a person? After thirty years your old life would be unrecognizable.  It doesn't make sense to punish someone that long because they're not even the same person they were when they committed the crime. Life in prison is *worse* than that.

&gt; It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested. 

It does matter that you agree with that decision, because these laws won't change until most people change their minds about stuff like this.  And until then, these people will be *bigger* drains on society because, like we both agreed on, it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff.
-----------
&gt;How do you eat when you don't have a job? 

Go to a homeless shelter, or a church, or a charity.  They're always dishing out food to the homeless.  

&gt;Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening. 

But in this instance, you're only in prison in life on the third offense.  The offender had two other chances to fix what he did wrong, but he chose to make the same mistakes again.  

&gt;it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff.

I agree, but it's also not worth it to have these people free to continue to commit the same crimes over and over again.  

Edit:  For the record, I agree about your point on schizophrenics.  In those instances, mental health evaluations would do a lot more good than a prison sentence.

&gt; Also, we don’t have free flow immigration right now. That’s not how it is today, and that’s not what literally any Democratic politician wants. 

Here is Keith Ellison wearing a T-shirt that says “I don’t believe in borders” in Spanish.

Keith Ellison is not just a democrat, he is the Deputy Chair of the DNC.

But how does that translate into actual policy? Is there anyone who has actually supported “open borders?”

It’s not a tenable position. And you’re creating a straw-man arguing that “open borders” is part of the Democratic platform.

The whole article is full of lies. 

Here is some real information: 

* The Department of Homeland Security \(DHS\) estimates that immigrants \(legal and illegal\) comprise 20 percent of inmates in prisons and jails. The foreign\-born are 15.4 percent of the nation’s adult population. However, DHS has not provided a detailed explanation of how the estimates were generated.

* The Federal Bureau of Prisons reports that 26.4 percent of inmates in federal prisons are non\-U.S. citizens. Non\-citizens are 8.6 percent of the nation’s adult population. However, federal prisons are not representative of prisons generally or local jails.
